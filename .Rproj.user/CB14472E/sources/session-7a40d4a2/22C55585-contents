Welcome! I am a Ph.D. student in Political Science at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign. My research interests include identity politics, immigrant integration and political behaviors of immigrants with a focus on Europe. 
In my dissertation, I explore the role of interactions with natives on immigrant political integration in Europe. I examine the extent to which interactions between natives and immigrants, with different levels of contact, can promote their psychological dimensions of political integration: political belonging, political trust, and political efficacy.
